## Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to solve various programming tasks. Each task includes a Python script that demonstrates basic concepts like input handling, loops, string manipulation, and more.

Tasks List
Reverse First and Last Name
Accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.

Compute n + nn + nnn
Accepts an integer n and computes the value of n + nn + nnn.

Heredoc String
Prints a multi-line string without needing to escape quotes or special characters.

Volume of a Sphere
Computes the volume of a sphere with a radius of 6.

Area of Triangle
Accepts the base and height of a triangle and computes the area.

Star Pattern (Pyramid)
Constructs a pyramid-like pattern of stars using nested loops.

Reverse a Word
Accepts a word from the user and reverses it.

Print Numbers Excluding 3 and 6
Prints all numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Fibonacci Series Up to 50
